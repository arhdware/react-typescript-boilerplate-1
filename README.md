# React TypeScript Boilerplate

This is an attempt at facilitating the starting of a new project with the
following features:

* ReactJS
* TypeScript
* TSLint - Fairly strict rules


## Getting Started

Make a copy of this repository to your new project's code folder and install
its dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:gvanderest/react-typescript-boilerplate.git <project>
cd <project>
yarn  # or npm install
```


## Planned Future Expansions

Add support for a few extra features:

* Jest testing
* Bundle analysis
* Minified vs Non-Minified
* Sourcemaps
* Less/Sass/CSS Compilation
* Service Worker support
